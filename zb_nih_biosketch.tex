\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}


\begin{enumerate}

\item I have training and expertise in protein- and phenotype-centered discovery of bio-active molecules with novel mechanisms of action. My primary research objective is to establish chemistry- and chemical biology-based technologies that can be used to study basic and disease biology. My research focused on interaction of small molecules and proteins, specifically through covalent and metal-ligating interactions.

\end{enumerate}
\item In addition to this, my research is focused on defining principles for designing libraries of small molecules based on the biological fingerprints recorded concurrent to their synthesis.

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item My early research focused on the development of new synthetic reagents for small molecule synthesis, primarily rooted in transition metal (copper, palladium, ruthenium) catalyzed processes. Specifically, I have shown that ligated copper hydride can be used to control various levels of selectivity (chemo-, regio-, or stereoselectivity) in organic reactions. Practical and robust reaction conditions described in these publications have since been used by synthetic chemists pursuing important biologically relevant targets.

\item \bibentry{Moser2010}
\item \bibentry{Baker2007}
\end{enumerate} 

\item I have used synthetic organic chemistry to elucidate structure--activity relationships and mechanisms-of-action of several biologically active molecules. This was primarily accomplished through detailed, hypothesis-driven structure--activity relationship studies, quantitative data analysis, and synthesis of probe molecules capable of profiling cellular proteome or reporting on cellular localization of small molecule-induced processes.
